## Course Description

Learn basic theory and  practices in Machine Learning in this intensive, sessions course. Topics include machine learning algorithm (clusterings, classifications, collaborative filterings), data processing(data treatment, processing and life cycling). Discover some of the lesser-known, yet useful, features of the Machine learning, such as how to solve problems based on statistical approach using python, java and scala(and spark)

You are encouraged to bring a laptop for in-class exercises.
